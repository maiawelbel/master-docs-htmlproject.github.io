neighborhoods are beginning to drive the city towards a greener future through urban food production.</p><p>In an attempt to capture  the magnitude of this movement, <a href="https://auachicago.org/" target="" class="" rel="">Advocates for Urban Agriculture</a> (AUA) teamed up with <a href="http://neighbor-space.org/" target="" class="" rel="">NeighborSpace</a> and DePaul University&#x2019;s <a href="https://resources.depaul.edu/steans-center-community-based-service-learning/Pages/default.aspx" target="" class="" rel="">Stean Center</a> to create the Chicago Urban Agriculture Mapping Project (CUAMP). This tool provides a directory with links to profiles of hundreds of projects from backyard gardens to commercial urban farms. Anyone who is growing food in the city can register to be added. This resource not only maps the progress of how much food is being grown in the city, but its creators say it also promotes community networking. Restaurants can search the directory for nearby gardens if they want to source locally grown food, and individuals looking to participate in a community garden can find out what is established in their neighborhood. The database currently has information on 858 urban farms and gardens, with new sites being added regularly. Geographic data shows the varying concentration of urban farms throughout the city. Ward 27, in the Garfield Park community area, has the highest number, with 55 urban farms and gardens. </p><div class="InlineHTML"><iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://mwelbel.carto.com/builder/cdaa3bee-9a5f-4e57-b81c-2183db49609c/embed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="InlineHTML"><iframe width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" src="https://mwelbel.carto.com/builder/586ee272-ee83-4cc0-bef3-8524fb16720d/embed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Uncommon Ground, a local-food focused restaurant in Edgewater, is home to the first Certified Organic rooftop farm in the U.S., as recognized by the Midwest Organic Services Association in 2008. Helen Cameron, who opened Uncommon Ground in 1991, talked about her experience cultivating an urban farm in Chicago.</p><p>Seated on the roof amongst chard leaves the size of elephant ears, Cameron said she worries that as a culture we have not emphasized the importance of knowing where food comes from. The garden at Uncommon Ground grows a wide range of vegetables and herbs, and Cameron said she works to maximize biodiversity not only to enhance her menu, but because she wants to provide as many educational opportunities as possible. </p><p>&#x201C;A lot of people who come here, they don&#x2019;t know where their food comes from they don&#x2019;t know how it grows. Even adults are like &#x2018;Oh my god, I didn&#x2019;t realize peas grew like that, or carrots are under the ground.&#x2019; I mean literally some people just have no idea. So I want to give an example of what&#x2019;s possible on a small scale, and how this idea is really expanding,&#x201D; she said.</p><p>Uncommon Ground&#x2019;s farm, overlooking Devon Avenue, uses square-foot gardening, a method of intensively growing plants so each square foot of soil produces maximum yield. The technique prescribes densely packing in a variety of plant species to prevent weeds and encourage soil vitality. Most of the produce is grown in irrigated raised beds, but there are also high-efficiency Earth Boxes, and a live wall, where planters are hung vertically. The rooftop produces an average of one to two pounds per square foot.</p><aside class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image"><picture><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source media="(min-width: 901px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2560x1706.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2082x1387.jpeg 2082w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-1511x1007.jpeg 1511w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-750x500.jpeg 750w"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2560x1706.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2082x1387.jpeg 2082w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-1511x1007.jpeg 1511w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-750x500.jpeg 750w"><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img src="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2560x1706.jpeg" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-55YIUNBhrC/IMG_1372-2560x1706.jpeg"></picture><div class="Theme-Caption Theme-InlineMediaCaption"><p>Live wall at Uncommon Ground </p></div></aside><p>&#x201C;People that come here are generally blown away because they don&#x2019;t expect to see something so lush and vibrant in this kind of situation. It is a finite amount of soil, and it took us years to figure out how to keep that soil alive and thriving, but now we have a good system, and you see the results every year,&#x201D; Cameron said. Uncommon Ground is the first rooftop farm in the U.S. to be certified organic, as recognized by the Midwest Organic Services Association in 2008.</p><p>Cameron maintains that her involvement in the greater community surrounding urban agriculture in Chicago has played a large role in the success of the farm. &#x201C;Within the city we are involved in a lot of community type things, so that connects us. And the city is very supportive of advancing urban agriculture as much as we possibly can I think. It&#x2019;s great for communities, it&#x2019;s great to start economies, and this is a way for people to learn job functions,&#x201D; she said. Cameron is on the leadership council of Growing Home, an organization that uses urban farming to provide transitional work and job readiness training to individuals with employment barriers, located in Englewood on the south west side of the city. She describes urban agriculture as a means of &#x201C;giving people a second chance at life.&#x201D;</p><p>Cameron explained that although perpetuating the urban agriculture movement in Chicago was not what she had in mind when she first opened Uncommon Ground, this aspect has become central to the restaurant&#x2019;s mission. The farm team at Uncommon Ground now trains interns every year, many of which have gone on to pursue their own food production endeavors throughout the city. Stephanie Davis was an intern at Uncommon Ground in 2012 and later became the head farmer at Growing Home. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s doing an awesome job, and growing way more food than we are able to here, now passing her knowledge along to all these other people,&#x201D; Cameron noted. </p><p>Jen Rosenthal, who was the first farm director at Uncommon Ground, now runs Planted Chicago, which creates custom edible landscapes for Chicago area chefs, restaurants, and bars, and offers larger scale cultivation on a quarter-acre farm in Bronzeville. &#x201C;I hadn&#x2019;t thought of how this was going to help further the movement [when we first started the rooftop farm], but it&#x2019;s something I am particularly proud of. Being able to grow all this great food is a very special thing, but to have that extra layer&#x2014;which is to pass this along on a much grander scale&#x2014;is really awesome.&#x201D;</p><aside class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image"><picture><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source media="(min-width: 901px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2560x1829.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2078x1485.jpeg 2078w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-1522x1087.jpeg 1522w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-750x536.jpeg 750w"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2560x1829.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2078x1485.jpeg 2078w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-1522x1087.jpeg 1522w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-750x536.jpeg 750w"><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img src="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2560x1829.jpeg" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-C9J3xlXA8z/IMG_1332-2560x1829.jpeg"></picture><div class="Theme-Caption Theme-InlineMediaCaption"><p>Rows of chard at The Talking Farm </p></div></aside><p>When Uncommon Ground first began, Richard M. Daley was mayor of Chicago. Cameron had already been working with the Department of the Environment in her efforts to become one of the greenest restaurants in the nation. Through this connection, she discovered that the city was offering grants to Chicago business owners to help them build rooftop gardens. The project the restaurateur had in mind was different from most other proposals, as hers involved relatively large-scale food production, whereas others were more focused on sustainable architecture. But after discussing the idea with Suzanne Malec-McKenna, who was the Commissioner the Department of the Environment at the time, Uncommon Ground was granted $20,000 from a pool of previous grants that had been earmarked for green roof projects.</p><p> Uncommon Ground did not encounter any licensing issues in constructing the garden, but still had to comply with building codes and obtain approval from a structural engineer that the project was viable. According to Cameron, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was elected in 2011, has been supportive of the movement in general. Much of this support is related to the mayor&#x2019;s attempts to improve food access throughout Chicago&#x2019;s underserved neighborhoods. In 2013, the city released data to track efforts to combat food deserts, including a <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Map-of-Urban-Farms/uti6-fp3f" target="" class="" rel="">map</a> of some of the city&#x2019;s  prominent urban farms. &#x201C;This data is critical to continue making progress, and will serve as a source for all those involved in eliminating food deserts to reference, explore and use in the very important work they are doing for our city,&#x201D; said Emanuel.</p><p>One notable project the mayor has supported is the creation of an urban agriculture district in Englewood as a means of improving food security and employment. The idea for an urban agriculture district began when Teamwork Englewood was working on a quality of life plan for the South West Side neighborhood. With a population of 30,654, Englewood&#x2019;s poverty level in 2013 was 42.2 percent and its unemployment rate 21.3 percent. Englewood was recognized as a food desert until 2016, when the neighborhood&#x2019;s first Whole Foods Supermarket opened its doors. Commissioning the new grocery store was part of Mayor Emanuel&#x2019;s initiative to increase food access and economic opportunity in Englewood. Subsidized by tax dollars, the store is able to charge reduced prices on many stock items in accordance with the needs of its patrons. It is slightly smaller than the average Whole Foods, and offers more &#x201C;365&#x201D; house brand and prepared foods. The opening of this location meant 2,648 more residents in Englewood now live within a mile of a grocery store. Whole Foods also committed to recruiting a portion of their employees from the Englewood community by partnering with Kennedy-King College, a city college nearby that specializes in food and hospitality, and selling products made by local entrepreneurs.</p><div class="InlineHTML"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The long-awaited <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeFoods">@WholeFoods</a> in Englewood is officially open for business!

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Teamwork Englewood was created as a part of the New Communities Program&#x2014;a 16-neighborhood community development initiative sponsored by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the MacArthur Foundation that ran from 2003 to 2013. The plan included development strategies such as new housing for a range of income levels, increasing the number of retail establishments, and optimizing a network of cultural activities, health and social services, and recreation programs to promote health and safety. Urban agriculture was a natural component of the plan. Growing food in Englewood would simultaneously address a number of objectives; putting vacant lots to productive use, increasing access to fresh produce, offering employment and job training opportunities, and building community cohesion.</p><p>Growing Home got involved early in the Teamwork Englewood project. The organization had been offering training since 2002, and began development on an urban farm on Wood Street in Englewood in 2006. Growing home now operates two USDA-certified organic high-production farms. Harry Rhodes, the executive director, said that in early stages of development, Chicago&#x2019;s zoning policies posed considerable challenges. After securing land from the city to build the Wood Street Farm, it took a year for the law department to provide a redevelopment agreement, they waited nine months to receive a business permit, and the property was eventually zoned as a technical institute because there was no code specific to urban farms at the time. It was in part due to the precedent the Wood Street Farm set that the city established a more streamlined zoning process for establishing an urban farm. Growing Home&#x2019;s Honore Street Farm was the first to open under the new ordinance. Rhodes maintains that certain municipal demands like parking and landscaping requirements are still problematic, but it is now significantly easier for Growing Home to do its work.</p><p>Growing Home has made significant progress towards its mission in Englewood. According to their 2015 Annual Report, Growing Home produced 30,844 pounds of produce, all of which was sold within a 20-mile radius. The majority of individuals who enroll in Growing Home&#x2019;s 14-week training program have an arrest record and do not have stable housing at the time of enrollment. Of the 39 people who participated in the program in 2015, 82 percent graduated, and 84 percent of graduates went on to secure full-time employment afterwards.</p><p>Also among the plans for transforming Englewood into an urban agriculture district is the New ERA (Englewood Remaking America) Trail. In 2009, a preliminary design for the trail was released, which outlined how the trail would redefine the neighborhood as a hub of green technology and green jobs. According to the report, &#x201C;Urban agriculture/horticulture themed redevelopments will provide opportunities for education, job training and new food sources within the community.&#x201D; The Wood Street Farm lies alongside the core of the trail, whose footprint lies on an abandoned L track. In 2015, the city completed a land swap with the Norfolk Southern Railway Company, which previously owned the trail corridor.</p><p>A vision for community-controlled farm space along the New ERA Trail was described in 2015 in a report created by the Urban Farm Pathways Project&#x2014;a group created to connect urban farmers to available land. Participants in the project include Angelic Organics, Growing Home, Growing Power, and Windy City Harvest. According to the report, &#x201C;Urban farmers will create community-based farm enterprises in Englewood along the elevated rail viaduct between 58th and 59th Streets. Englewood Community Farms will provide land for-profit or cooperative farming operations on contiguous parcels of land. The farmers will control and manage their own operations, while sharing resources such as tools, soil amendments, refrigeration, hoop houses, fencing and security and build a support network with local partners.&#x201D; Because redevelopment of the approximated 700 acres of vacant land in Englewood will be a multi-year process, urban agriculture has been made a priority means of land use. Small-scale farms can be established on plots as small as a 40&#x2019; X 125&#x2019; lot, and can start producing relatively quickly. There is also great potential for phased growth of agriculture sites, as the farm could expand if land becomes available around it, production intensity could increase by building hoop houses or implementing other technologies, and food-processing, refrigeration, or retail operations could be integrated onsite. Urban farms would become keystone elements of a thriving community and economy in Englewood.</p><p>Both Rhodes and Cameron stress the impact that AUA&#x2014;a coalition of individuals, organizations, and businesses that work to support urban agriculture in Chicago&#x2014;has had in the evolution of the movement. AUA advocates for policy that better allows for the expansion of urban agriculture in Chicago; acts as a hub through which urban farmers can share information, resources, and best practices; and connects practitioners, projects, and consumers, through their network. One of the issues the group is currently working on is creating recommendations for business permits that are relevant to urban agriculture projects. Thanks to a 2011 zoning amendment, it is feasible to get land zoned specifically for an urban farm of any type. After that, however, the process becomes murkier. There are currently no business permits specific to urban agriculture, leaving farmers guessing at what type of permit to request. This uncertainty makes the businesses more vulnerable to being penalized for violations of municipal regulations and may limit potential for expansion in the future. </p><aside class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image"><picture><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source media="(min-width: 901px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2560x3413.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2114x2818.jpeg 2114w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-1540x2053.jpeg 1540w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-750x1000.jpeg 750w"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2560x3413.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2114x2818.jpeg 2114w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-1540x2053.jpeg 1540w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-750x1000.jpeg 750w"><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img src="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2560x3413.jpeg" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-djjo10Tv9n/IMG_1703-2560x3413.jpeg"></picture><div class="Theme-Caption Theme-InlineMediaCaption"><p>Guests enjoying a farm dinner at AUA&apos;s annual Summer Soir&#xE9;e and Showcase, hosted in the garden at Big Delicious Planet in West Town </p></div></aside><p>AUA is looking at the best practices in other cities that have adopted urban agriculture business permits, and hopes Chicago will eventually offer permits designed specifically for various types of projects such as indoor aquaponics operations, farms in a residential area, or rooftop greenhouses. According to Christy Spees, AUA Outreach Coordinator, the organization&#x2019;s goal is to secure a place for urban agriculture in the city&#x2019;s regulatory structure. &#x201C;Right now, nothing says &#x2018;if you&#x2019;re trying to start and urban agriculture business, these are the things that you need.&#x2019; Whereas if you&#x2019;re trying to open a restaurant or a coffee shop, those rules and regulations are very clear,&#x201D; Spees said.</p><p>A major function of AUA has been to address the laws and regulations currently in place that impede the work of urban farmers. For example, in 2015 Chicago&#x2019;s composting ordinance was amended to allow urban farms and community gardens to accept organic waste generated off site, and permit qualifying urban farms to sell finished compost. The amendment also made the process of creating a community composting facility less arduous, and decreased the cost of procuring a permit by a factor of ten. AUA worked with the Illinois Environmental Council and the Chicago Food Policy Action Council to push these changes through. AUA is currently trying to change an ordinance that limits the size and height weeds can be in residential areas. Chicago residents who grow plants that look and act like weeds in their garden for supplemental purposes such as attracting pollinators or beneficial insects are being asked to get rid of those plants because they are prohibited by the ordinance. This often happens when a neighbor does not like the look of an un-manicured garden and reports it. AUA wants to encourage sustainable landscapes and support backyard gardeners, so the group is in conversation with the city to lift the restriction.</p><p>Another issue AUA deals with is land-availability and ownership. &#x201C;Community gardens are often started on vacant lots that they do not own. The problem with that is they can very easily be &#x2018;evicted,&#x2019; so to speak,&#x201D;  Spees said. Without any official claim to the plot, gardeners can be asked to uproot to make way for some type of development at any time. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not really an ideal scenario,&#x201D; she said. The organization hopes the city will eventually designate land for agricultural use rather than simply making undesignated land available.</p><p>City Farm is working on the flip-side of this issue by creating urban farms on vacant lots that are designed to be &#x201C;intentionally nomadic.&#x201D; According to Meredith Coulter, who works for the organization, the mobile farming structure makes it possible to move the operation to a new site if the land is purchased for development. City Farm seeks out parcels of land lying fallow in the city&#x2014;ideally the plot is one acre or larger and available for at least three to five years&#x2014;and builds a full-cycle, chemical-free farm that can produce thousands of pounds of produce per acre per year, and creates three to four full time jobs as well as seasonal work. </p><aside class="InlineMedia InlineMedia--image"><picture><!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]--><source media="(min-width: 901px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2560x1707.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2101x1401.jpeg 2101w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-1516x1011.jpeg 1516w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-750x500.jpeg 750w"><source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2560x1707.jpeg 2560w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2101x1401.jpeg 2101w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-1516x1011.jpeg 1516w,./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-750x500.jpeg 750w"><!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--><img src="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2560x1707.jpeg" srcset="./media/section-8KG5pGDEtM/landscape/image-bf3mV0ywNJ/IMG_1389-2560x1707.jpeg"></picture><div class="Theme-Caption Theme-InlineMediaCaption"><p>City Farm on Division Street</p></div></aside><p>City Farm was created by The Resource Center, an environmental education nonprofit organization focused on minimizing waste by utilizing underused or overlooked resources. Other Resource Center programs include triple-sort recycling and hazardous waste disposal. Compost plays a large role in City Farm&#x2019;s model, and with the help of AUA&#x2019;s efforts and Chicago&#x2019;s new composting ordinance, the organization was able to create a &#x201C;Food-to-Farm&#x201D; service, through which food scraps are picked up from restaurants and other institutions and then used for compost.</p><p>Within this network of urban farms and organizations, activists are empowering one another through financial and technological support, community and professional engagement, legal guidance, publicity and marketing.
